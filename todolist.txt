========= the contract ==============
    What does my state ("data") look like?
What do my objects look like?
-> What do my express APIs look like?

Each "thing" is a "calculation":
calculation = 
{
    whoseJoke: "Luke",,
    jokeQuestion:"Two fish are in a tank. What did one fish say to the other?",
    punchLine: "Do you know how to drive this thing?"
}

POST /calculations
{
    whoseJoke: "Luke",,
    jokeQuestion:"Two fish are in a tank. What did one fish say to the other?",
    punchLine: "Do you know how to drive this thing?"
}

GET /calculations
[
    {
    whoseJoke: "Luke",,
    jokeQuestion:"Two fish are in a tank. What did one fish say to the other?",
    punchLine: "Do you know how to drive this thing?"
        solution: 8 
    },
    {
        firstNumber: 12,
        secondNumber: 4,
        operator: "+",
